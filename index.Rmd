## Motivation

Remember in *Linear Regression* project we are asked to train a model to predict `mpg` based on `mtcars` dataset? 

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars,3)
```

--- .class #id 

## Linear model training in R

It's very straight forward to train a model using predictor(s) from the dataset and plot the result in R Studio. However it's tedious to try out every combination and type them in command line. What if the user knows nothing about R?

```{r,fig.height=4,fig.width=8,fig.align='center'}
fit <- lm(mpg~cyl,data=mtcars);
plot(mpg~cyl,data=mtcars);abline(fit)
```

## Linear model training with ShinyApp

My [ShinyApp](https://tiagolicanton.shinyapps.io/data_prod/) provides an interactive way to

1. to select/deselect predictors 
2. present trained model immediately
3. record the best $R^2$ so far

---

## Usage
The only input widget is the checkbox in the left side, play with it and the corresponding model will be calculated accordingly. The model with max $R^2$ will be recorded in case you forget the best model so far. Lastly, please note that $R^2_{max}$ is not the indicator of how good the model is. User should make a tradeoff between model precision and simplicity in his/her discretion.
